# Explanation of views.py as a Whole
# The views.py file in your Django REST Framework (DRF) application defines API endpoints that handle user authentication, notes, and book management. It follows a class-based view (CBV) approach, leveraging DRF's generic views to simplify CRUD operations.

# Breakdown of Each Section
# USER MANAGEMENT
# CreateUserView

# Allows new users to register.

# Uses AllowAny, meaning authentication is not required to create an account.

# Uses UserSerializer to handle user data.

# NOTES MANAGEMENT
# NoteListCreate

# Lists and creates notes.

# Only authenticated users can access (IsAuthenticated).

# get_queryset() ensures users can only view their own notes.

# perform_create() ensures newly created notes are automatically assigned to the logged-in user.

# NoteDelete

# Deletes a note.

# Ensures that only the note‚Äôs author can delete it.

# BOOK MANAGEMENT
# BookListCreate

# Lists and creates books.

# Similar to notes, users can only access their own books.

# New books are assigned to the logged-in user.

# BookDelete

# Deletes a book.

# Ensures that only the book‚Äôs author can delete it.
